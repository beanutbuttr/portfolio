            My short film called “Hey Diary, I think I’m in love”
            is about a journal entry and a love for all kinds of things.
            </br></br>
            A girl goes to the park to write in her journal about things she loves —
            simple things like balloons and trees, but also the things she used to
            love like jumping on the couch and poking her baby sister’s cheeks.
            </br></br>
            When you meet someone, one of the first things you share are the things you love -
            your interests, passions, favorite foods and favorite memories. This short film is
            dedicated to those moments.
