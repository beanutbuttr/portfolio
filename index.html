                <div class="about-body">
                    Hi! I'm Beatrice. I grew up in Austin, TX and now live in Providence, RI
                    where I am a junior at Brown University. I am a part-time piano teacher,
                    and I am looking for internship and co-op opportunities in the Gaming, Software Engineering, and Digital Media
                    industries.
                    </br></br>
                    I am interested in combining programming and the arts in computer vision, building games
                    Virtual Reality applications, frontend development, and creating other forms of new media - I have a
                    few examples of my projects below!
                    </br></br>
                    In my free time I enjoy solving Rubik's cubes, skateboarding, swimming, watching movies, and finding
                    seashells along the beach.
                    </br></br>

                    <div class="project-name">VR Piano Visualizer</div>
                </div>

                <div class="project-description" id="vr-piano-desc">
                    Inspired by my piano students who watch reactive piano visualizers on YouTube to help
                    them practice at home, I created an application that visualizes midi data in virtual reality.
                    </br></br>
                    While 2D visualizers are able to represent note pitch and duration on a piano,
                    they are unable to represent the volume of each note in an intuitive way.
                    In the VR Piano Visualizer, volume is represented by note height.
                    </br></br>
                    This application was created using Unity and Fusion 360. Features include:</br>
                    Wayfinding</br>
                    Volume represented by height of the key</br>
                    Choose from 5 songs</br>
                    Play/Pause playback</br>

                    What does it mean to find mutual understanding with the completely alien?
                    How do you renegotiate space peacefully with the environment you find yourself in,
                    and can you make yourself part of that world without compromising your own identity?
                    What do you become when you fully commit to the understanding of another world?
                    Our game seizes around the idea of not only exploring a space but internalizing space,
                    the way that the spaces we exist in increase our capacity for empathy and understanding
                    if we are willing to listen to them.

                    is about a journal entry and a love for all kinds of things.
                    A girl goes to the park to write in her journal about things she loves —
                    simple things like balloons and trees, but also the things she used to
                    love like jumping on the couch and poking her baby sister’s cheeks.
                    </br></br>
                    When you meet someone, one of the first things you share are the things you love -
                    your interests, passions, favorite foods and favorite memories. This short film is
                    dedicated to those moments.

                    Directed, written, and shot by me.
